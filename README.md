# Status Update 
Here is what I'm currently working on:
- [ ] Changing the color theme of the website. The website is going to have multiple different color themes. 
- [ ] Improving the responsiveness for mobile devices.
- [X] Revamping the card menu for the index page. 
- [ ] Adding additional content to the index page. 

Remarks:
* 14th of Januaray: I implemented the error page as well as the card menu for the index. Though, it is worth mentioning that I wasn't able to get good pictures for my projects, which is why I opted for random placeholder images, instead. Right now, these placeholder images only are supposed to show how the card menu would look like if I had proper images. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to implement the mobile menu today - as well the changelog page. Because of this, I will add these tasks to the ones I planned to do tomorrow. 
 
# Planned
Note: the prototype for this website is scheduled to be finished at the 15th of January. 
* 14th of January: finishing the index page, *i.e.* creating and finishing the card menu - as well as adding some final edits to the index page, adding the hamburger menu to improve the mobile responsiveness, creating the error page, and creating the changelog page.  
* 15th of January: adding the new color theme (and editing) the about page, the contact page, and archive page - as well as adding the current implementation of the memory game to the archive page, and adding the hamburger menu to all the pages.   
 
After I have finished the prototype of the website, I will work on the following things:
* 16th of January: implementing whatever minor fixes and changes are needed to improve the overall look of the prototype, planning and researching all the other features of the memory game, improving the overall file structure of the website, and adding additional (minor) features to the archive page. 
* 17th of January: adding the color theme function to the website, adding my resume to the website, and improving the responsiveness for the contact form - as well as the memory board. 

# Maintenance
